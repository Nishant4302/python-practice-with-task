# ----------------------------------------------if statements------------------------------------------- 


# An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword
# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b

a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")


# ===============================================Elif=====================================================

# The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")

# ===========================================Else=====================================================

# The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")


# Short Hand If

if a > b: print("a is greater than b")

# Short Hand If ... Else

a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")
